# For my use:
  ## Basic Typography guidelines
  ## Taken from https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/web-typography/#other-basic-typography-guidelines

  - Use a font-size between 14px and 20px for the body element.
  - Use “curly quotes” and apostrophes with the &rsquo;, &lsquo;, &rdquo;, and &ldquo; HTML entities.
  - Use proper dashes (&ndash;, &mdash;) and other symbols (&copy;).
  - Don’t use text-decoration: underline except for hover states.
  - Use real italic fonts over synthesized ones if not it’s too much of a performance burden.
